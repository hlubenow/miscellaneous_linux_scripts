# miscellaneous_linux_scripts

This repository provides several smaller scripts, used on Linux.

- shufflemp3.pl: Shuffles the mp3s in and below a directory and plays them with "mpg123" (or "mpg321").
- m: "m" is a little (Perl-)script I use, to play local media files of different types in a directory on the Linux console.
- radioplay.pl - Lets you select an internet radio station from a list, and play it with MPlayer.
- lower.pl: Renames a file, lowering its filename and stripping problematic characters from it.
- mehrwertsteuer.pl: A little script to calculate the German "Mehrwertsteuer".
