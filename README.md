# miscellaneous_linux_scripts

Here is a bunch of smaller scripts, typically used on the Linux console.

- shufflemp3.pl: Shuffles the mp3s in and below a directory and plays them with "mpg123" (or "mpg321").
- m: "m" is a little script I use, to quickly play media files of various types in a directory, without having to figure out which player to use for each file.
- radioplay.pl - Lets you select an internet radio station from a list, and plays it with MPlayer.
- lower.pl: Renames a file, lowering its filename and stripping problematic characters from it.
- mehrwertsteuer.pl: A little script to calculate the German "Mehrwertsteuer".
- dreisatz.pl: A simple script to calculate "rule of three" ("Dreisatz" in German).
- makecrypt.pl: May create an encrypted data container on OpenSuSE Linux 13.1
- stopwatch.pl: A simple stopwatch just for minutes and seconds (uses Perl/Tk).
- randomstring.pl: Prints a string generated by random.

License: GNU GPL 3 (or above) (except "shufflemp3.pl", which has the same license as Perl itself, which should be compatible with the GNU GPL too though).
