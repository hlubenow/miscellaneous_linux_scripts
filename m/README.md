### m - Play multimedia-file(s)

"m" is a little (Perl-)script I use,
to play media files of different types on the Linux console.

When I want to play a video clip, I don't want to mess with cryptic commands
such as "mplayer -fs af volnorm [file]" and so on. I also don't want to think
about, which program to use. I just throw every filename at "m", and if it
recognizes a media file, it plays it. That's very convenient.
I often just use "m *", for example.

"m" is configured with the player programs I use, such as
mplayer (movies), mpg321 (mp3s), xmp (tracker-mods) and so on.
If you want other programs, you'd have to edit the script.
