#### randomstring.pl 1.0

This script prints a string, that may contain capital letters, small letters or numbers. All characters in the string are generated by random.

I don't have any idea, to what purpose such a string could be used. (So you can't blame me, if you use such a string (for whatever), and the result somehow doesn't meet your expectations.)

The default number of the string's characters is 16. The string's length can be set by passing a number between 1 and 100 as an option to the script, like for example `./randomstring.pl 20`.
