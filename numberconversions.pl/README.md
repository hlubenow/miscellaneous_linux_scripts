#### numberconversions.pl 1.1

Simple conversions between decimal, hexadecimal and binary numbers (probably mostly interesting for software developers).

You can pass a number as an option to the script, or the script just asks you for a number on the command-line.

Using the program "[convbits](https://sourceforge.net/projects/convbits/)" may even be more convenient, but I had problems compiling it (with Qt5).
