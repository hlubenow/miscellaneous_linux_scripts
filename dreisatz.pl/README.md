dreisatz.pl 1.0

Simple script to calculate "rule of three" ("Dreisatz" in German).

a  |  b
c  |  d

When you have three numbers a, b and c, where "a" corresponds proportionally to "b", and  
"c" corresponds proportionally to "d", how large is "d" then?

The script tells the answer (d = b * c / a), when you pass three values for a, b and c on the command line to it.

When you pass a fourth argument containing the term "anti", an antiproportional relation is assumed in the script instead of a proportional one.

Why write such a script? Well, sometimes this "rule of three" situation appears (that's why it's taught relatively early in school), and I just want a quick answer then, without every time having to imagine the table with the four values above.
